## About

**Pixl** Pixl is a pixel-themed [YSWS](https://hackclub.com) where you evolve in a retro 2D open world and level up by building real projects. By exploring the map, you will discover different regions such as a cyberpunk city, an underwater region or even a gambling one (regions comming soon, not in game yet). Each region will have sidequests like making apps, websites, or hardware for in-game characters that will pay you with a base prize (or base funding for hardware) and give you some pixels, the in-game currency, for you to spend in the shop. The more pixels you get, the best regions you can unlock and the more pixels you will get from the merchants.

- **Shared open world** - explore with other Hack Clubbers in real time
- **Private village** - your own personal space
- **Shop & economy** - spend Pixels on a shop to get prizes (mainly grants as we know you love that)
- **Custom skins** - draw your own 16×16 pixel avatar --- WILL BE ADDED LATER
- **Chat & voice** - communicate with nearby players
- **Project submissions** - ship projects via the in-game **Pip** NPC
- **Hackatime integration** - coding time is automatically tracked and rewarded

## Features

### Multiplayer World
A real-time top-down world. Explore the shared **open world** with other players in real time, or head to your own **village**.

### Consistency system (for the future ysws, not implemented yet)
The more project you ship, the best merchants you unlock in your village, meaning that they will pay you more !

### Pixel Economy (for the future ysws, not implemented yet)
Earn **Pixels** by shipping projects. Spend them in the shop on prizes. Prices are enforced server-side — no spoofing possible.

### Character Customisation 
Choose from 5 preset character skins, or open the **Skin Editor** to draw a completely custom 16×16 avatar. Your skin is saved to your account and broadcast to all nearby players.

### Project Submissions (YSWS) (for the future ysws, not implemented yet)
Talk to the **Pip** NPC in your village to submit projects with a name, description, repo URL, and demo link. Link your [Hackatime](https://hackatime.hackclub.com/) account to automatically sync coding time to your projects.

## Authentication Flow

```
Client
  └─▶ GET /auth/login
        └─▶ Hack Club consent screen
              └─▶ GET /auth/callback  (token exchange + /api/v1/me)
                    └─▶ Redirect to client with #auth=<sessionToken>
                          └─▶ Client stores token in localStorage
                                └─▶ Sent in socket handshake → server/auth.ts validates
```

- Accounts and tokens are stored in the SQLite `accounts` table with a 30-day sliding session expiry.
- Game state (position, pixels) is keyed by Hack Club account ID.
- **One active session per account** — a new login kicks the previous session.

## World System

Players exist in exactly one world at a time, identified by a `WorldRef`:

| Kind | Description |
|---|---|
| `openworld` | Shared world for all players |
| `village` | Your own village |
| `house` | Single shared multiplayer interior |

World switches are requested via the `world:enter` socket event. The server validates access and emits `world:state` with the new player list. Walking onto a door tile triggers building entry; a portal tile switches between the open world and your village.
