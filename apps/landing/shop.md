# PIXL Shop — Inventory

Conversion rate: **1 h of work = $3.5 = 50 pixels**. Shop price (px) = hours × 50, hours rounded to the nearest 0.5h. $3.5/h is the floor rate; it only goes up from there once a shipped project's Restoration Energy multiplier kicks in. The shop UI shows each item's hours as a range, e.g. `2-1.2h`: hours needed at the $3.5/h floor, then hours needed at $6/h (an assumed high-end multiplied rate) — `hoursOf()`/`hoursRange()` in `Shop.tsx` and the two `apps/game/web/shop/*.html` pages.

Dollar values and fulfillment notes are internal reference only — the website shows pixel prices only, no dollar estimates.

**2026-07-29 repricing pass**: every item below was re-reviewed against real-world $ costs and recomputed with the exact formula above (previous prices were mostly hand-rounded and had drifted). See `apps/server/drizzle/0062_shop_reprice_3_5_rate.sql` for the DB migration. Left alone on purpose: Signed Org Photo (kept at 100px/2h — niche/cool item, not a formula price), Random Desk Object (kept at 200px/4h — deliberate value-add override, not a formula price), and the Framework 13/16 DIY configurators (priced per-component, not flat).

The website list lives in `app/_components/Shop.tsx` (`generalItems`, rendered as a marquee carousel like the Sidequests section). This file is the recap: if you change an item, update **both places** (see note at the bottom).

## General Shop (buyable with pixels, sorted by price)

The "ID" column is a mnemonic label for humans only — `Shop.tsx` items are plain `{ name, description }` objects with no `id` field, matched to price/image purely by array position (see "Where to edit items" below).

| ID | Name | Hours | Price (px) | Internal cost / fulfillment notes | Image |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| `signed-photo` | Signed Org Photo | 2.5 h | 125 | ~$3 shipping + ~$1 photo; envelope near-free if we buy ~20 per member at once. **+10% niche bump, then rounded up to the next half-hour (was 100px)** | `/shop/signed-photo.png` (fanned polaroid of the 3 orgs' Slack pfps) |
| `meme-pack` | Community Meme Pack (5-Pack) | 2.5 h | 125 | 5 random memes made by the community team, printed on real photo paper. ~$5 real cost (prints + envelope), priced like Signed Org Photo rather than the raw formula price — a fun collectible, not a grant. **+10% niche bump, then rounded up to the next half-hour (was 100px).

## Sidequest Rewards (not buyable — earned by completing sidequests)

Shown on the site in the Sidequests section (`Sidequests.tsx`, "min Xh of work" labels), not in the Shop carousel.

## Removed vs previous shop

- **Blahaj Plush** → new shop item (700 px / 14 h), a purchased plush toy. **Not the same as the 3D Printed Blahaj**, which is a separate object (the trophy, not in the shop)
- **Epomaker TH80 V2 Pro** → removed; **Epomaker x Aula F75** renamed to **Epomaker x Aula S75 Pro** (now has the little screen), consolidating what used to be two competing keyboard options into one
- **Nintendo Switch Online (1 year)** → dropped from the new list (image kept)
- **GitHub Pro (1 year)** → dropped from the new list (image kept)
- **Sony WH-1000XM4** → replaced by the XM5
- **27" 4K Monitor** → replaced by the stackable monitor grant
- **Arduino Starter Kit** → removed earlier (image `/shop/arduino.png` kept)

## Placeholder / pending images

- All images are now in place — no more SVG placeholders. `signed-photo.png` is a fanned polaroid composite (the 3 orgs' Slack pfps); `mystery-box.png`, `hardware-grant.png`, `apple-dev.png`, `steam-license.png` are real/generated images swapped in after the initial batch.
- All other images (including the 9 new grant/license icons — `hardware-grant`, `domain-grant`, `hosting-grant`, `cpu-grant`, `gpu-grant`, `ram-grant`, `google-play`, `steam-license`, `apple-dev` — and the real photos for `pencil-pro` and `ipad-air-m4`) are in place, no longer pending.
- `nintendo-switch-2.png` is pending — new item added in the 2026-07-29 repricing pass, no image yet.
- `meme-pack.png` is pending — new item, no image yet (memes are community-made, so this one needs an actual photo of a printed pack once they're made).

## Where to edit items

The shop is now localized (en/fr/es/pt). Name and description live in each locale's dictionary; image and price are locale-independent and live in `Shop.tsx`.

1. **Text (name/description)**: `app/[lang]/dictionaries/{en,fr,es,pt}.json` → `shop.items`, a flat array. **Order matters** — item *i* in this array must line up with index *i* in `ITEM_IMAGES`/`ITEM_PRICES` below, so the same insertion position is needed in all 4 files.
2. **Image + price**: `app/_components/Shop.tsx` → `ITEM_IMAGES` and `ITEM_PRICES`, two parallel arrays indexed the same way as the dictionaries. `NICHE_INDICES` flags which indices get the red star badge (currently 0, 1, 10, 12, 18 — signed-photo, meme-pack, mystery-box, cookie-cutter, aseprite). The card also derives an hours figure from `price / 50` and shows it in small text next to the pixel price.
3. **This file**: `shop.md` — the tables above, for the human-readable recap with $ costs and fulfillment notes.

Nothing here is synced automatically: adding/reordering an item means touching all 4 dictionaries + both Shop.tsx arrays + this file, keeping every index aligned.
