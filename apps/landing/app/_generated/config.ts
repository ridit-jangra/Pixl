 * within a few cents of a tier-1 one. This kicker fixes that - +$0.50/hour per
 * tier step above T1.
 *
 * It only applies to the first `tierKickerHours` of a project, because a long
 * tier-4 project is *already* rewarded: it builds RE five times faster, which
 * permanently lifts the rate on everything shipped afterwards. Without the cap a
 * 150h project's tier gap more than doubles and the margin on exactly the most
 * expensive projects sags. With it, the margin stays flat across project sizes.
 *
 * Known trade-off: this makes splitting one long project into several
 * kicker-length submissions worth something. Reviewers see the submissions, so
 * it is visible rather than silent, but it is a real hole - the pure-RE version
 * had none.
